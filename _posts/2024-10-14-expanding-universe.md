This is the part where I predict the future.  

What I'm expecting to see in next couple years:

- More diverse group of programmers, with agents adapting a new population to programming jobs.  Experience will come faster thanks to our assistant who knows everything (just ask).     
- More programming jobs, though 'programming' will often be about adapting different parts of the world for model consumption.  One off tools are much cheaper and easier to develop.  We need to help agents adapt to the places where they are needed, where they provide value.
