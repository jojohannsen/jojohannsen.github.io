Trying out https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers

Got Claude desktop, tried this for `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/johannesjohannsen/claude_desktop"
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

Getting an error when Claude desktop starts:

![Claude desktop startup error](/images/mcp.png)

Then tried memory, got same error.   This was because I needed to start the server, with:

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

But this didn't work, because I did not have `npx` installed, which required:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
# setup nvm
vi ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile
# verify install
nvm --help
nvm install node  # latest version
node --version
npm --version
npx --version

# now the server will ru
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

I totally missed this 'run-server' step.  Actually checked back, filesystem didn't mention it.  But it sort of is in the json file, the command to run, the parameters.  I just did not realize that I had to do this manually.  I thought Claude desktop did this, why else would the complete command be there?  Or is this a problem somehow with my installation?  That would make more sense.
