#### Why am I blogging?

Actually, I'm not sure that I am, this is only day 3.

But as to why -- it's because of [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/).   I haven't read his blog (yet), it's really because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRuLgar5XZw" target="_blank">this TWIML podcast</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRpHNB87gRY" target="_blank">maybe this Pragmatic Programmer podcast</a>.  

Simon makes great tools and has put a lot of time into working with models, and when asked about how to get better at working with AI, he said to write.   So I'm writing.
