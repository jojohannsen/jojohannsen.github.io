This is how I'm spending my retirement.

## Projects
These are things that are beyond my abilities.  However, models will assist me.  I'm still working out
exactly *how* the models will help.  But looking forward to this way of working, and what is now possible.

- gen_graph - langgraph architectures experimental UI and representation, to make things easier for reasoning assistant.
- life_maps - conversation processing agent for building data context around time, place, and memories
- human_llm - tight coupling of human and LLM for navigating reasoning tasks
- mem_assist - augmented reality and conversational data to provide personal context for a situation
- regulation_navigator - RAG pipeline for navigating collections of regulations
- cleaner_merger - agents for working with human to merge data of varying quality into an existing database
